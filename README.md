I'm a software developer passionate about technology and what I do. To those who know me, I usually say that "those who do what they like, live on vacation". That's why I'm constantly looking to learn something new that will help me become an even better developer.

I currently work on Front-End with technologies such as: React, Tailwind, Typescript, Bootstrap, Git & Github
But I also like to venture into the Back-End with Node, Typescript, Python and MySQL

I'm always looking to improve myself and learn.
Feel free to send me a message and ask more about me or my work!
